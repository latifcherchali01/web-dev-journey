# Web Development Journey

This repository documents my journey to becoming a professional web developer.

## Goals

- Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Build 3 real projects in 90 days
- Track progress and challenges

## Project Structure

- `index.html` → main HTML file
- `style.css` → CSS for layout and styling
- `script.js` → JavaScript for interactivity

## Notes

- All code is for learning purposes
- Daily commits will track progress
